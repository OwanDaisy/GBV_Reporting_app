            <p class="story-text">
                As a male nurse in a predominantly female profession, I never expected to experience sexual harassment. But my female supervisor made my work life unbearable with inappropriate comments, unwanted touching, and threats about my job security if I didn't comply with her advances.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                For months, I stayed silent. I worried that no one would believe me—that I'd be accused of misunderstanding or even blamed for "encouraging" the behavior. The toxic environment affected my mental health and my ability to care for patients, but I feared retaliation if I spoke up.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                The breaking point came when she threatened to falsify reports about my performance unless I agreed to meet her outside of work. I knew then that this would never stop unless I took action. I documented everything and contacted HR, but initially, they dismissed my concerns.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Refusing to be silenced, I sought legal advice and connected with other professionals who had experienced workplace harassment. With their support, I filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The process was grueling, but I refused to back down.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                After a lengthy investigation, my supervisor was terminated, and the hospital implemented new training programs on workplace harassment that specifically address the experiences of male victims. I received a settlement that allowed me to take time to heal and eventually transition to a new position where I now help develop anti-harassment policies.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Harassment knows no gender, and silence helps no one. By speaking out, I not only reclaimed my power but helped create a safer environment for others. If you're experiencing workplace harassment, document everything, know your rights, and don't be afraid to seek legal counsel.
            </p>
