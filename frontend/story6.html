                I was 17 when a man posing as a modeling scout promised me a career in fashion. Instead, he trafficked me across state lines and forced me into prostitution. For five years, I was moved between cities, my documents confiscated, my spirit systematically broken with drugs, threats, and violence.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                I believed escape was impossible. My trafficker convinced me that police would arrest me, that my family had abandoned me, and that I was worthless except for the money I could earn him. The psychological chains felt more powerful than the physical ones.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                My chance for freedom came during a hospital visit after a client became violent. A nurse noticed my distress and the controlling behavior of the man who brought me in. When he stepped out, she slipped me a card for a human trafficking hotline and created a distraction so I could make a call.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                That call changed everything. Within hours, advocates from a specialized trafficking rescue organization were at the hospital. They worked with law enforcement to ensure my safety and placed me in a secure recovery program designed specifically for trafficking survivors.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Recovery has been the hardest journey of my life. I had to detox from drugs, address complex trauma, and learn basic life skills that had been denied to me. But with comprehensive support—therapy, education, job training, and legal assistance—I've rebuilt a life I never thought possible.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Today, I'm a certified counselor working with other trafficking survivors. I'm also pursuing a degree in social work to better serve this community. My trafficker was convicted and is serving a 25-year sentence, and I've reconnected with my family who never stopped searching for me.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                To anyone trapped in trafficking situations: Please know that help exists and there are people who understand the complexities of your situation. You are not what was done to you, and freedom is possible. Look for safe opportunities to reach out—medical settings, public restrooms, or even writing notes to service workers.
            </p>
