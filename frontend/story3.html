                In my community, women's choices were never their own. At 19, my family arranged my marriage to a man twice my age. I was told it was for my protection and our family's honor, but I soon discovered it was a prison sentence disguised as tradition.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                For years, I endured emotional abuse and control under the guise of cultural norms. I wasn't allowed to pursue education, have friends, or even choose what to wear. When I expressed my desire to study nursing, I was told I was bringing shame to the family by being "too ambitious."
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                The turning point came when my younger sister turned 17, and my family began arranging her marriage. Seeing history repeat itself gave me courage I didn't know I had. I reached out to a university professor I had secretly been in contact with, who connected me with an organization that helps women in forced marriages.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Leaving was the most difficult decision of my life. I knew I would lose my family and community, but I couldn't bear to see my sister suffer the same fate. With the help of advocates, I found safe housing and legal support to nullify my marriage.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Today, I'm a registered nurse and advocate for women's rights in traditional communities. My sister is now in university studying law, and we've built a new chosen family of supportive friends and mentors.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Culture should never be a weapon used against women. True honor lies in respecting individual dignity and choice. To anyone facing similar circumstances: Your dreams matter, your voice matters, and there are people who can help you find safety while respecting your cultural identity.
            </p>
