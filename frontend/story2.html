            <p class="story-text">
                As a man who survived sexual assault, I struggled for years with shame and the misconception that this only happens to women. I was attacked by someone I considered a friend after a night out. The trauma left me broken, questioning my masculinity, and isolated in my pain.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                For three years, I told no one. I developed anxiety, struggled with intimacy, and used work to avoid dealing with my emotions. I believed the lie that men should be strong enough to handle anything and that what happened was somehow my fault.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                My healing began when I stumbled upon an online forum for male survivors. For the first time, I realized I wasn't alone. Reading others' stories gave me the courage to seek therapy specifically for trauma survivors.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Through therapy, I learned that vulnerability is not weakness and that my worth isn't defined by what happened to me. I started practicing mindfulness and began the difficult work of processing my trauma rather than avoiding it.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Today, I facilitate a support group for male survivors and speak at colleges about consent and sexual assault awareness. I've learned that healing isn't about forgetting what happened but about integrating it into my story without letting it control my narrative.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                To other men who have experienced sexual violence: Your pain is valid. Your experience is real. There is no shame in seeking help, and your healing matters.
            </p>
