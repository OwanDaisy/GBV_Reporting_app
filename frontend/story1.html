                For seven long years, I lived in silence. The vibrant, outspoken woman I once was had been systematically diminished by constant criticism, control, and eventually physical violence. I believed the narrative that I was worthless, that no one would believe me, and that I deserved the treatment I received.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                The turning point came when my daughter, then five years old, drew a picture of our family. In her artwork, I was crying while her father stood over me with a large hand raised. Seeing my pain through her eyes broke something in me—and simultaneously awakened my fighting spirit.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. The fear was paralyzing, but the thought of my daughter growing up thinking this was normal gave me courage. With the help of a women's shelter, I found safety and began the long journey of rebuilding.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Therapy helped me understand that the abuse was never about my worth but about control. I learned to separate what happened to me from who I am. Slowly, I rediscovered my voice—first in whispers to my counselor, then in stronger statements to legal advocates, and finally in sharing my story with other survivors.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                Today, I work as a advocate for domestic violence survivors. My past no longer defines me, but it fuels my purpose. I've learned that our voices are our power, and when we share our stories, we break the isolation that abuse thrives on.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-text">
                If you're in a similar situation, please know: Your voice matters. Your story matters. You are not alone, and what happened to you is not your fault. Help is available, and a different future is possible.
